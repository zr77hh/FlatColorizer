Important Notes:

1.every mesh you want to flat colorize should have a unique name since this plugin uses the name to save the mesh data.

2.you should not delete or change the directory or change the name of the FlatColorizerData folder unless you know what you are doing since that might risk losing mesh data so make sure to make a backup before playing around with the FlatColorizerData folder. but in normal you should not worry about this folder at all.
